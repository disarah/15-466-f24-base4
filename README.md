# Rags to Raccoon

Author: Sarah Di (sarahdi)

Design: My game is about a raccoon spending a day in New York.

Text Drawing: The in game text is defined in Script.cpp and rendered at runtime. (TODO: how does the text drawing in this game work? Is text precomputed? Rendered at runtime? What files or utilities are involved?)

Choices: (TODO: how does the game store choices and narrative? How are they authored? Anything nifty you want to point out?)

I also composed a small 15 bar song that plays in the background.

Screen Shot:

How To Play:

You are a Raccoon that likes shiny things. 
(TODO: describe the controls and (if needed) goals/strategy.)

Sources: (TODO: list a source URL for any assets you did not create yourself. Make sure you have a license for the asset.)

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
